# my-vim-setup

The base for this vim setup is [ets-labs python-vimrc](https://github.com/ets-labs/python-vimrc). Hence, .vimrc file was initialized by:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ets-labs/python-vimrc/master/setup.sh)"
```

Then, I adjusted it a little bit to myself.

Note: 

* Vundle is necessary, of course. 
* YCM needs additional installation.
